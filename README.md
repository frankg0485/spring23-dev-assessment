Hi, this is my take-home assessment for bits of good 2025! I was able to complete levels 0-3 but ran out of time for 4. To be honest this was my first time using a NoSQL DB (mongoDB) and I've learned a lot from just this project. I think my experience with MySQL and other relational DBs definitely helped, and it turns out the mongoose library was very useful in managing the collections within the NoSQL DB. I for sure still have lots to learn but I'm really excited to dive deeper into backend development!
